# MRX80SQUARE
A square inch 80m direct conversion receiver  

This project was done as a thought experiment to see if a simple 80m receiver could fit on a 25.4mm x 25.4mm two layer pcb.  
It is possible, but the battery and headphone jack need a separate pigtail.  
The SMA antenna jack did fit.  
As the project name suggests, this is a derivate of the classic MRX40 direct conversion receiver.  
As the MRX40 is the classic SA602+LM386 combo, so is this one. 
Changes include slightly different crystal oscilaltor component values and re-calculated RF input matching.  
This project also makes extensive use of SMD components, mostly in the 0402 and 0805 sizes along with SOIC-8 SA612 and LM386.

None of these have so far never been made and I'm concentrating my efforts towards the "Mark2" redesing.  
So I would not consider this production ready for anything, but an example of one potential solution.
